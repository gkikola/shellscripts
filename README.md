Greg Kikola's Shell Scripts

These are just a few Bash shell scripts that I occasionally find
useful.

Scripts
-------

* checkplaylist: Read an .m3u playlist and verify that all of the
  files in the playlist exist.
* listincompatiblefilenames: Find files within a directory (and its
  subdirectories) having names that might not be compatible with other
  filesystems. If no directory is given, then use the current
  directory.
* pdfmerge: Combine separate PDF files into a single PDF file. The
  actual merging is performed using Ghostscript (gs).
